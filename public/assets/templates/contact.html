                <h2>Short Bio</h2>
                <p>I’m a full-stack web developer driven to create functional, inspirational and fun applications. Before I
                    could drive, I would take computers apart, and rebuild them, adding parts that would make them act
                    better. I've always had an interest in computers, and I was drawn to programming because it was a
                    creative outlet and allowed me to control those computers I loved to build. I find it exciting to be
                    able to create a useful, quality product from a spark of an idea.</p>

               <p>My passions include my family, computers, food and music.  Recently I have picked up table tennis and
                   golf.</p>

                <p>I created the projects in my portfolio using JavaScript, AngularJS, Node, Express, MongoDB, Elastic
                Search and Firebase, among many other technologies.</p>
