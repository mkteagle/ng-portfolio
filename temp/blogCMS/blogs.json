Right when the party was scheduled to start I thought, &quot;What the heck, let&apos;s go.&quot; The decision made for an amazing morning and we will definitely be going next year too!&nbsp;</span></p><p>KUED and Discovery Gateway hold a birthday party for Dr. Seuss right outside of the museum. So it&apos;s free, but if you decide to go to the museum after, you will only have to pay for admission! The birthday party provided age-appropriate activities for my almost two and a half year old.</p><p>They had an area where she got to color on the wall (sign a birthday card for Dr. Seuss).</p><p>An area where she got to color/decorate a hat, just like the cat in the hat.</p><p>Oh and the Cat in the Hat was there! My daughter had never watched the Cat in the Hat before and wasn&apos;t really sure who he was. She was so intrigued by him, kept looking for him and asking where he was, but then saying, &quot;Don&apos;t come near me.&quot; LoL. After the party I brought her home and turned on the Cat in the Hat show and I am pretty sure next year she is going to be thrilled to see him.</p><p>They had an adorable area set up for photos and some cute photo props. My daughter had a great time playing in the hot air balloon and with the stuffed animals. It was a bonus when the cat in the hat came and joined her for a pic. Of course then she couldn&apos;t stop looking at him. You could tell she was just processing the fact that he was standing behind her.</p><p>There was a place for the kids to watch the show, and read Dr. Seuss books.</p><p>An area where they got a snack (goldfish crackers) and were able to sort them by colors on a &quot;One Fish, Two Fish&quot; Dr. Seuss inspired activity sheet with them. That was super cute.</p><p>There was an area where they used noodles to create a line and then traced it and colored the sheet.</p><p>They also had a science area where she used soda cans as a telephone. That was a little old for her but she enjoyed it all the same.</p><p>Overall, the party had a lot of little things that really added up to make it great. She had a fun time going from one area to another and then back again. It was a smaller room so I had an easy time keeping track of her and was able to join her in some of the activities too. I can&apos;t wait to take her back next year and once again celebrate Dr. Seuss&apos;s birthday! I think it will be even more fun because I am going to make sure she knows more about Dr. Seuss by then!</p>",
